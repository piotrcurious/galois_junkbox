/* Finding the roots of a 5th degree polynomial can be quite complex, as there's no general analytical solution for polynomials of degree five or higher due to the Abel-Ruffini theorem. However, a numerical approach can be used to approximate the roots. Here's an example of how you might implement a function in Arduino code for an ESP32 to find the roots of a 5th degree polynomial using a combination of analytical methods for possible rational roots and numerical methods for the remaining roots:

*/
#include <math.h>

// Function to evaluate the polynomial at a given value x
double polynomial(double x) {
    // Replace with your specific 5th degree polynomial coefficients
    double a = 1; // x^5 coefficient
    double b = 0; // x^4 coefficient
    double c = 0; // x^3 coefficient
    double d = 0; // x^2 coefficient
    double e = 0; // x^1 coefficient
    double f = 0; // constant term

    return a*pow(x, 5) + b*pow(x, 4) + c*pow(x, 3) + d*pow(x, 2) + e*x + f;
}

// Function to find the derivative of the polynomial
double polynomial_derivative(double x) {
    // Replace with the derivative of your specific 5th degree polynomial
    double a = 5; // x^4 coefficient
    double b = 0; // x^3 coefficient
    double c = 0; // x^2 coefficient
    double d = 0; // x^1 coefficient

    return a*pow(x, 4) + b*pow(x, 3) + c*pow(x, 2) + d*x;
}

// Newton-Raphson method to find a root near a given approximation x0
double newton_raphson(double x0, double tolerance, int max_iterations) {
    double x = x0;
    double x_prev;
    int iterations = 0;

    do {
        x_prev = x;
        x = x_prev - polynomial(x_prev) / polynomial_derivative(x_prev);
        iterations++;
    } while (fabs(x - x_prev) > tolerance && iterations < max_iterations);

    return x;
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);

    // Example usage: Finding a root near an initial guess of x0 = 1
    double root = newton_raphson(1, 0.0001, 100);
    Serial.print("A root is: ");
    Serial.println(root, 6); // Print the root with a precision of 6 decimal places
}

void loop() {
    // Nothing to do here
}
/*

This code uses the Newton-Raphson method for finding a root, which is a numerical method. You'll need to provide the specific coefficients of your polynomial in the `polynomial` function. Also, you may need to run the `newton_raphson` function multiple times with different initial guesses to find all the roots. Remember that this method finds one root at a time, and it requires a good initial guess to converge.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not find all roots, especially if they are complex. For a more robust solution, you might consider implementing additional numerical methods or using a library that specializes in finding polynomial roots..
