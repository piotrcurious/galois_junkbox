Computing fractions to represent irrational numbers often involves the use of continued fractions, which provide increasingly accurate rational approximations of irrational numbers. For example, the square root of 2 can be approximated by an infinite continued fraction, and truncating this fraction at different points gives a sequence of rational numbers that converge to the square root of 2¹².

Galois theory, on the other hand, is a branch of abstract algebra that deals with the symmetries in the roots of a polynomial equation, particularly those that cannot be solved using radicals (i.e., cannot be expressed using a finite combination of the four basic arithmetic operations and nth roots). It connects field theory and group theory and allows for the characterization of polynomial equations that are solvable by radicals⁵.

The relationship between the computation of fractions for irrational numbers and Galois theory lies in the fact that both deal with the nature of numbers and their representations. While continued fractions allow us to approximate irrational numbers, Galois theory helps us understand the deeper structure of equations and their solvability, including whether certain roots (which may be irrational) of a polynomial can be expressed in terms of radicals.

In essence, while computing fractions for irrational numbers is a numerical approximation method, Galois theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding the solvability and symmetries of algebraic equations, some of which may have irrational solutions. The two concepts intersect in the study of algebraic numbers, which are roots of polynomial equations with rational coefficients, and can be either rational or irrational. Galois theory can tell us about the properties of these numbers, including their approximations by rational numbers..
